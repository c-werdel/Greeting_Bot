# Greeting_Bot with AWS, Python and Slack


## A simple greeting bot for Slack using Lambda and AWS Services

This project is an example of setting up a simple slack_bot that sends out a greeting notification every work day M-F. 
It was designed using a simple python code and linked to slack and AWS. Every part of this project shows how to do the following:

*Create a custom bot using Slack blocks, Python and AWS EventBridge
*Create a simple python script with a slack block to visualize the bots information within slack. 
* Setup a CD pipeline with GIT Runners to update the bot with every new code push.
